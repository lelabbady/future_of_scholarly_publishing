	abstract = {Synaptic activity initiates many adaptive responses in neurons. Here we report a novel form of structural plasticity in dissociated hippocampal cultures and slice preparations. Using a recently developed algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction and quantitative measurements of cell organelles, we found that many nuclei from hippocampal neurons are highly infolded and form unequally sized nuclear compartments. Nuclear infoldings are dynamic structures, which can radically transform the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity. Action potential bursting causing synaptic {NMDA} receptor activation dramatically increases the number of infolded nuclei via a process that requires the {ERK}-{MAP} kinase pathway and new protein synthesis. In contrast, death-signaling pathways triggered by extrasynaptic {NMDA} receptors cause a rapid loss of nuclear infoldings. Compared with near-spherical nuclei, infolded nuclei have a larger surface and increased nuclear pore complex immunoreactivity. Nuclear calcium signals evoked by cytosolic calcium transients are larger in small nuclear compartments than in the large compartments of the same nucleus; moreover, small compartments are more efficient in temporally resolving calcium signals induced by trains of action potentials in the theta frequency range (5 Hz). Synaptic activity-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 was more robust in neurons with infolded nuclei compared with neurons with near-spherical nuclei, suggesting a functional link between nuclear geometry and transcriptional regulation. The translation of synaptic activity-induced signaling events into changes in nuclear geometry facilitates the relay of calcium signals to the nucleus, may lead to the formation of nuclear signaling microdomains, and could enhance signal-regulated transcription.},

To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, here we analysed 23,822 cells from two areas at distant poles of the mouse neocortex: the primary visual cortex and the anterior lateral motor cortex. We define 133 transcriptomic cell types by deep, single-cell {RNA} sequencing. Nearly all types of {GABA} (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing neurons are shared across both areas, whereas most types of glutamatergic neurons were found in one of the two areas. By combining single-cell {RNA} sequencing and retrograde labelling, we match transcriptomic types of glutamatergic neurons to their long-range projection specificity. Our study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct areas of the adult mouse cortex.},

In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds and well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named {PointNet}, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, {PointNet} is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.},

	abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit extreme diversity in gene expression as well as in morphological and electrophysiological properties1,2. Most existing neural taxonomies are based on either transcriptomic3,4 or morpho-electric5,6 criteria, as it has been technically challenging to study both aspects of neuronal diversity in the same set of cells7. Here we used Patch-seq8 to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell {RNA} sequencing of more than 1,300 neurons in adult mouse primary motor cortex, providing a morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. We found that, although broad families of transcriptomic types (those expressing Vip, Pvalb, Sst and so on) had distinct and essentially non-overlapping morpho-electric phenotypes, individual transcriptomic types within the same family were not well separated in the morpho-electric space. Instead, there was a continuum of variability in morphology and electrophysiology, with neighbouring transcriptomic cell types showing similar morpho-electric features, often without clear boundaries between them. Our results suggest that neuronal types in the neocortex do not always form discrete entities. Instead, neurons form a hierarchy that consists of distinct non-overlapping branches at the level of families, but can form continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within families.},

	abstract = {3D electron microscopy ({EM}) has been successful at mapping invertebrate nervous systems, but the approach has been limited to small chunks of mammalian brains. To scale up to larger volumes, we have built a computational pipeline for processing petascale image datasets acquired by serial section {EM}, a popular form of 3D {EM}. The pipeline employs convolutional nets to compute the nonsmooth transformations required to align images of serial sections containing numerous cracks and folds, detect neuronal boundaries, label voxels as axon, dendrite, soma, and other semantic categories, and detect synapses and assign them to presynaptic and postsynaptic segments. The output of neuronal boundary detection is segmented by mean affinity agglomeration with semantic and size constraints. Pipeline operations are implemented by leveraging distributed and cloud computing. Intermediate results of the pipeline are held in cloud storage, and can be effortlessly viewed as images, which aids debugging. We applied the pipeline to create an automated reconstruction of an {EM} image volume spanning four visual cortical areas of a mouse brain. Code for the pipeline is publicly available, as is the reconstructed volume.},

Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of {PCs} can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical {PCs}. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of {PCs} in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.},

In this report we describe long, dynamic tubular channels, derived from the nuclear envelope, that extend deep into the nucleoplasm. These channels show cell-type specific morphologies ranging from single short stubs to multiple, complex, branched structures. Some channels transect the nucleus entirely, opening at two separate points on the nuclear surface, while others terminate at or close to nucleoli. These channels are distinct from other topological features of the nuclear envelope, such as lobes or folds., The channel wall consists of two membranes continuous with the nuclear envelope, studded with features indistinguishable from nuclear pore complexes, and decorated on the nucleoplasmic surface with lamins. The enclosed core is continuous with the cytoplasm, and the lumenal space between the membranes contains soluble {ER}-resident proteins (protein disulphide isomerase and glucose-6-phosphatase)., Nuclear channels are also found in live cells labeled with the lipophilic dye {DiOC}6. Time-lapse imaging of {DiOC}6-labeled cells shows that the channels undergo changes in morphology and spatial distribution within the interphase nucleus on a timescale of minutes., The presence of a cytoplasmic core and nuclear pore complexes in the channel walls suggests a possible role for these structures in nucleo–cytoplasmic transport. The clear association of a subset of these structures with nucleoli would also be consistent with such a transport role.},

These properties display both discrete and continuous variation among t-types.

	abstract = {L-Measure ({LM}) is a freely available software tool for the quantitative characterization of neuronal morphology. {LM} computes a large number of neuroanatomical parameters from 3D digital reconstruction files starting from and combining a set of core metrics. After more than six years of development and use in the neuroscience community, {LM} enables the execution of commonly adopted analyses as well as of more advanced functions. This report illustrates several {LM} protocols: (i) extraction of basic morphological parameters, (ii) computation of frequency distributions, (iii) measurements from user-specified subregions of the neuronal arbors, (iv) statistical comparison between two groups of cells and (v) filtered selections and searches from collections of neurons based on any Boolean combination of the available morphometric measures. These functionalities are easily accessed and deployed through a user-friendly graphical interface and typically execute within few minutes on a set of ∼20 neurons. The tool is available at http://krasnow.gmu.edu/cn3for either online use on any Java-enabled browser and platform or download for local execution under Windows and Linux.},

However, in practice, anatomical connectivity and physiology have been studied mostly separately. Following in the footsteps of previous studies that have combined physiology and anatomy in the same tissue, here we present a unique functional connectomics dataset that contains calcium imaging of an estimated 75,000 neurons from primary visual cortex ({VISp}) and three higher visual areas ({VISrl}, {VISal} and {VISlm}), that were recorded while a mouse viewed natural movies and parametric stimuli. The functional data were co-registered with electron microscopy ({EM}) data of the same volume which were automatically segmented, reconstructing more than 200,000 cells (neuronal and non-neuronal) and 524 million synapses. Subsequent proofreading of some neurons in this volume yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections. The largest proofread excitatory axon reached a length of 19 mm and formed 1893 synapses, while the largest inhibitory axon formed 10081 synapses. Here we release this dataset as an open access resource to the scientific community including a set of analysis tools that allows easy data access, both programmatically and through a web user interface.},

	abstract = {The importance of context in regulation of gene expression is now an accepted principle; yet the mechanism by which the microenvironment communicates with the nucleus and chromatin in healthy tissues is poorly understood. A functional role for nuclear and cytoskeletal architecture is suggested by the phenotypic differences observed between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Capitalizing on recent advances in cryogenic techniques, volume electron microscopy and super-resolution light microscopy, we studied human mammary epithelial cells in three-dimensional (3D) cultures forming growth-arrested acini. Intriguingly, we found deep nuclear invaginations and tunnels traversing the nucleus, encasing cytoskeletal actin and/or intermediate filaments, which connect to the outer nuclear envelope. The cytoskeleton is also connected both to other cells through desmosome adhesion complexes and to the extracellular matrix through hemidesmosomes. This finding supports a physical and/or mechanical link from the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes to the nucleus, which had previously been hypothesized but now is visualized for the first time. These unique structures, including the nuclear invaginations and the cytoskeletal connectivity to the cell nucleus, are consistent with a dynamic reciprocity between the nucleus and the outside of epithelial cells and tissues.},

	abstract = {Alteration of the nuclear Ca2+ transient is an early event in cardiac remodeling. Regulation of the nuclear Ca2+ transient is partly independent of the cytosolic Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes. One nuclear membrane protein, emerin, is encoded by {EMD}, and an {EMD} mutation causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ({EDMD}). It remains unclear whether emerin is involved in nuclear Ca2+ homeostasis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of emerin in rat cardiomyocytes by means of hypertrophic stimuli and in {EDMD} induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cell-derived cardiomyocytes in terms of nuclear structure and the Ca2+ transient. The cardiac hypertrophic stimuli increased the nuclear area, decreased nuclear invagination, and increased the half-decay time of the nuclear Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes. Emd knockdown cardiomyocytes showed similar properties after hypertrophic stimuli. The {EDMD}-{iPS} cell-derived cardiomyocytes showed increased nuclear area, decreased nuclear invagination, and increased half-decay time of the nuclear Ca2+ transient. An autopsied heart from a patient with {EDMD} also showed increased nuclear area and decreased nuclear invagination. These data suggest that Emerin plays a crucial role in nuclear structure and in the nuclear Ca2+ transient. Thus, emerin and the nuclear Ca2+ transient are possible therapeutic targets in heart failure and {EDMD}.},

To systematically profile morpho-electric properties of mammalian neurons, we established a single-cell characterization pipeline using standardized patch-clamp recordings in brain slices and biocytin-based neuronal reconstructions. We built a publicly accessible online database, the Allen Cell Types Database, to display these datasets. Intrinsic physiological properties were measured from 1,938 neurons from the adult laboratory mouse visual cortex, morphological properties were measured from 461 reconstructed neurons, and 452 neurons had both measurements available. Quantitative features were used to classify neurons into distinct types using unsupervised methods. We established a taxonomy of morphologically and electrophysiologically defined cell types for this region of the cortex, with 17 electrophysiological types, 38 morphological types and 46 morpho-electric types. There was good correspondence with previously defined transcriptomic cell types and subclasses using the same transgenic mouse lines.},

Martinotti cells ({MCs}) mostly displayed ovoid-shaped somata, bitufted dendritic morphologies, and axons with characteristic spiny boutons projecting to layer I and spreading horizontally across neighbouring columns more than 1 mm. Electron microscopic examination of {MC} boutons revealed that all synapses were symmetrical and most synapses (71\%) were formed onto dendritic shafts. {MCs} were found to contact tuft, apical and basal dendrites in multiple neocortical layers: layer {II}/{III} {MCs} targeted mostly layer I and to a lesser degree layer {II}/{III}; layer {IV} {MCs} targeted mostly layer {IV} and to a lesser degree layer I; layer V and {VI} {MCs} targeted mostly layer {IV} and layer I and to a lesser degree the layer in which their somata was located. {MCs} typically displayed spike train accommodation (90\%; n= 127) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections, but some displayed non-accommodating (8\%) and a few displayed irregular spiking responses (2\%). Some accommodating and irregular spiking {MCs} also responded initially with bursts (17\%). Accommodating responses were found in all layers, non-accommodating mostly in upper layers and bursting mostly in layer V. Single-cell multiplex {RT}-{PCR} performed on 63 {MCs} located throughout layers {II}–{VI}, revealed that all {MCs} were somatostatin ({SOM}) positive, and negative for parvalbumin ({PV}) as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide ({VIP}). Calbindin ({CB}), calretinin ({CR}), neuropeptide Y ({NPY}) and cholecystokinin ({CCK}) were co- expressed with {SOM} in some {MCs}. Some layer-specific trends seem to exist. Finally, 24 accommodating {MCs} were examined for the expression of 26 ion channel genes. The ion channels with the highest expression in these {MCs} were (from highest to lowest); Caβ1, Kv3.3, {HCN}4, Caβ4, Kv3.2, Kv3.1, Kv2.1, {HCN}3, Caα1G, Kv3.4, Kv4.2, Kv1.1 and {HCN}2. In summary, this study provides the first detailed analysis of the anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells located in different neocortical layers. It is proposed that {MCs} are crucial interneurones for feedback inhibition in and between neocortical layers and columns.},

In contrast to excitatory pyramidal neurons, insight into the structural plasticity of inhibitory neurons remains limited. Interneurons are divided into various subclasses, each with specialized functions in cortical circuits. Further knowledge of subclass-specific structural plasticity of interneurons is crucial to gaining a complete mechanistic understanding of their contribution to cortical plasticity overall. Here, we describe a subpopulation of superficial cortical multipolar interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide ({VIP}) with high spine densities on their dendrites located in layer (L) 1, and with the electrophysiological characteristics of bursting cells. Using longitudinal imaging in vivo, we found that the majority of the spines are highly dynamic, displaying lifetimes considerably shorter than that of spines on pyramidal neurons. Using correlative light and electron microscopy, we confirmed that these {VIP} spines are sites of excitatory synaptic contacts, and are morphologically distinct from other spines in L1.},

Some algorithms in the context of multiresolution representation and modeling can be performed much more efficiently and robustly if the underlying surface tesselations have the special subdivision connectivity. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for converting a given unstructured triangle mesh into one having subdivision connectivity. The basic idea is to simulate the shrink wrapping process by adapting the deformable surface technique known from image processing. The resulting algorithm generates subdivision connectivity meshes whose base meshes only have a very small number of triangles. The iterative optimization process that distributes the mesh vertices over the given surface geometry guarantees low local distortion of the triangular faces. We show several examples and applications including the progressive transmission of subdivision surfaces.},

Here, we reconstruct the 3D circuits formed by thalamocortical afferents from the lemniscal pathway and excitatory neurons of an anatomically defined cortical column in rat vibrissal cortex. We objectively classify 9 cortical cell types and estimate the number and distribution of their somata, dendrites, and thalamocortical synapses. Somata and dendrites of most cell types intermingle, while thalamocortical connectivity depends strongly upon the cell type and the 3D soma location of the postsynaptic neuron. Correlating dendrite morphology and thalamocortical connectivity to functional responses revealed that the lemniscal afferents can account for some of the cell type- and location-specific subthreshold and spiking responses after passive whisker touch (e.g., in layer 4, but not for other cell types, e.g., in layer 5). Our data provides a quantitative 3D prediction of the cell type-specific lemniscal synaptic wiring diagram and elucidates structure-function relationships of this physiologically relevant pathway at single-cell resolution.},

	abstract = {Morphology based analysis of cell types has been an area of great interest to the neuroscience community for several decades. Recently, high resolution electron microscopy ({EM}) datasets of the mouse brain have opened up opportunities for data analysis at a level of detail that was previously impossible. These datasets are very large in nature and thus, manual analysis is not a practical solution. Of particular interest are details to the level of post synaptic structures. This paper proposes a fully automated framework for analysis of post-synaptic structure based neuron analysis from {EM} data. The processing framework involves shape extraction, representation with an autoencoder, and whole cell modeling and analysis based on shape distributions. We apply our novel framework on a dataset of 1031 neurons obtained from imaging a 1mm x 1mm x 40 micrometer volume of the mouse visual cortex and show the strength of our method in clustering and classification of neuronal shapes.},

	abstract = {We acquired a rapidly preserved human surgical sample from the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. We stained a 1 mm3 volume with heavy metals, embedded it in resin, cut more than 5000 slices at ∼30 nm and imaged these sections using a high-speed multibeam scanning electron microscope. We used computational methods to render the three-dimensional structure containing 57,216 cells, hundreds of millions of neurites and 133.7 million synaptic connections. The 1.4 petabyte electron microscopy volume, the segmented cells, cell parts, blood vessels, myelin, inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and 104 manually proofread cells are available to peruse online. Many interesting and unusual features were evident in this dataset. Glia outnumbered neurons 2:1 and oligodendrocytes were the most common cell type in the volume. Excitatory spiny neurons comprised 69\% of the neuronal population, and excitatory synapses also were in the majority (76\%). The synaptic drive onto spiny neurons was biased more strongly toward excitation (70\%) than was the case for inhibitory interneurons (48\%). Despite incompleteness of the automated segmentation caused by split and merge errors, we could automatically generate (and then validate) connections between most of the excitatory and inhibitory neuron types both within and between layers. In studying these neurons we found that deep layer excitatory cell types can be classified into new subsets, based on structural and connectivity differences, and that chandelier interneurons not only innervate excitatory neuron initial segments as previously described, but also each other’s initial segments. Furthermore, among the thousands of weak connections established on each neuron, there exist rarer highly powerful axonal inputs that establish multi-synaptic contacts (up to ∼20 synapses) with target neurons. Our analysis indicates that these strong inputs are specific, and allow small numbers of axons to have an outsized role in the activity of some of their postsynaptic partners.},

However, in practice, anatomical connectivity and physiology have been studied mostly separately. Following in the footsteps of previous studies that have combined physiology and anatomy in the same tissue, here we present a unique functional connectomics dataset that contains calcium imaging of an estimated 75,000 neurons from primary visual cortex ({VISp}) and three higher visual areas ({VISrl}, {VISal} and {VISlm}), that were recorded while a mouse viewed natural movies and parametric stimuli. The functional data were co-registered with electron microscopy ({EM}) data of the same volume which were automatically segmented, reconstructing more than 200,000 cells (neuronal and non-neuronal) and 524 million synapses. Subsequent proofreading of some neurons in this volume yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections. The largest proofread excitatory axon reached a length of 19 mm and formed 1893 synapses, while the largest inhibitory axon formed 10081 synapses. Here we release this dataset as an open access resource to the scientific community including a set of analysis tools that allows easy data access, both programmatically and through a web user interface.},

	abstract = {Synapses are the fundamental elements of the brain’s complicated neural networks. Although the ultrastructure of synapses has been extensively studied, the difference in how synaptic inputs are organized onto distinct neuronal types is not yet fully understood. Here, we examined the cell-type-specific ultrastructure of proximal processes from the soma of parvalbumin-positive ({PV}+) and somatostatin-positive ({SST}+) {GABAergic} neurons in comparison with a pyramidal neuron in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. Interestingly, each type of neuron organizes excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a unique way. First, we found that a subset of {SST}+ neurons are spiny, having spines on both soma and dendrites. Each of those spines has a highly complicated structure that has up to eight synaptic inputs. Next, the {PV}+ and {SST}+ neurons receive more robust excitatory inputs to their perisoma than does the pyramidal neuron. Notably, excitatory synapses on {GABAergic} neurons were often multiple-synapse boutons, making another synapse on distal dendrites. On the other hand, inhibitory synapses near the soma were often single-targeting multiple boutons. Collectively, our data demonstrate that synaptic inputs near the soma are differentially organized across cell types and form a network that balances inhibition and excitation in the V1.},

We have built a parallel imaging pipeline using transmission electron microscopes that scales this technology, implements 24/7 continuous autonomous imaging, and enables the acquisition of petascale datasets. The suitability of this architecture for large-scale imaging was demonstrated by acquiring a volume of more than 1 mm3 of mouse neocortex, spanning four different visual areas at synaptic resolution, in less than 6 months. Over 26,500 ultrathin tissue sections from the same block were imaged, yielding a dataset of more than 2 petabytes. The combined burst acquisition rate of the pipeline is 3 Gpixel per sec and the net rate is 600 Mpixel per sec with six microscopes running in parallel.

The current study describes a systematic approach to identify molecular correlates of specific projection neuron classes in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1), using a combination of in situ hybridization ({ISH}) data mining, marker gene colocalization, and combined retrograde labeling with {ISH} for layer-specific marker genes. First, we identified a large set of genes with specificity for each cortical layer, and that display heterogeneous patterns within those layers. Using these genes as markers, we find extensive evidence for the covariation of gene expression and projection target specificity in layer 2/3, 5, and 6, with individual genes labeling neurons projecting to specific subsets of target structures. The combination of gene expression and target specificity imply a great diversity of projection neuron classes that is similar to or greater than that of {GABAergic} interneurons. The covariance of these 2 phenotypic modalities suggests that these classes are both discrete and genetically specified.},

	abstract = {Alteration of the nuclear Ca2+ transient is an early event in cardiac remodeling. Regulation of the nuclear Ca2+ transient is partly independent of the cytosolic Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes. One nuclear membrane protein, emerin, is encoded by {EMD}, and an {EMD} mutation causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ({EDMD}). It remains unclear whether emerin is involved in nuclear Ca2+ homeostasis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of emerin in rat cardiomyocytes by means of hypertrophic stimuli and in {EDMD} induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cell-derived cardiomyocytes in terms of nuclear structure and the Ca2+ transient. The cardiac hypertrophic stimuli increased the nuclear area, decreased nuclear invagination, and increased the half-decay time of the nuclear Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes. Emd knockdown cardiomyocytes showed similar properties after hypertrophic stimuli. The {EDMD}-{iPS} cell-derived cardiomyocytes showed increased nuclear area, decreased nuclear invagination, and increased half-decay time of the nuclear Ca2+ transient. An autopsied heart from a patient with {EDMD} also showed increased nuclear area and decreased nuclear invagination. These data suggest that Emerin plays a crucial role in nuclear structure and in the nuclear Ca2+ transient. Thus, emerin and the nuclear Ca2+ transient are possible therapeutic targets in heart failure and {EDMD}.},

Synaptic transmission between neurons is the basic unit of communication in neural circuits. The relative number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs across individual dendrites and neurons are the hardware of local dendritic and cellular computations. In this chapter, we discuss the structural and functional observations that have guided the understanding of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization across the neuronal arbor, the subcellular targeting properties of different neuronal subtypes, and the effects of synaptic placement on local integration within dendritic segments. We focus primarily on the adult mammalian cortex and hippocampus, where excitatory and inhibitory cell types, their connectivity, and its functional implications have been best characterized.},

However, in practice, anatomical connectivity and physiology have been studied mostly separately. Following in the footsteps of previous studies that have combined physiology and anatomy in the same tissue, here we present a unique functional connectomics dataset that contains calcium imaging of an estimated 75,000 neurons from primary visual cortex ({VISp}) and three higher visual areas ({VISrl}, {VISal} and {VISlm}), that were recorded while a mouse viewed natural movies and parametric stimuli. The functional data were co-registered with electron microscopy ({EM}) data of the same volume which were automatically segmented, reconstructing more than 200,000 cells (neuronal and non-neuronal) and 524 million synapses. Subsequent proofreading of some neurons in this volume yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections. The largest proofread excitatory axon reached a length of 19 mm and formed 1893 synapses, while the largest inhibitory axon formed 10081 synapses. Here we release this dataset as an open access resource to the scientific community including a set of analysis tools that allows easy data access, both programmatically and through a web user interface.},

To better constrain the deﬁnition of neuronal cell types, we characterized the transcriptomes and intrinsic physiological properties of over 4,200 mouse visual cortical {GABAergic} interneurons and reconstructed the local morphologies of 517 of those neurons. We ﬁnd that most transcriptomic types (t-types) occupy speciﬁc laminar positions within visual cortex, and, for most types, the cells mapping to a t-type exhibit consistent electrophysiological and morphological properties. These properties display both discrete and continuous variation among t-types. Through multimodal integrated analysis, we deﬁne 28 met-types that have congruent morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties and robust mutual predictability. We identify layer-speciﬁc axon innervation pattern as a deﬁning feature distinguishing different met-types. These met-types represent a uniﬁed deﬁnition of cortical {GABAergic} interneuron types, providing a systematic framework to capture existing knowledge and bridge future analyses across different modalities.},

	abstract = {The nuclear envelope consists of a doublemembraned extension of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In this report we describe long, dynamic tubular channels, derived from the nuclear envelope, that extend deep into the nucleoplasm. These channels show cell-type specific morphologies ranging from single short stubs to multiple, complex, branched structures. Some channels transect the nucleus entirely, opening at two separate points on the nuclear surface, while others terminate at or close to nucleoli. These channels are distinct from other topological features of the nuclear envelope, such as lobes or folds., The channel wall consists of two membranes continuous with the nuclear envelope, studded with features indistinguishable from nuclear pore complexes, and decorated on the nucleoplasmic surface with lamins. The enclosed core is continuous with the cytoplasm, and the lumenal space between the membranes contains soluble {ER}-resident proteins (protein disulphide isomerase and glucose-6-phosphatase)., Nuclear channels are also found in live cells labeled with the lipophilic dye {DiOC}6. Time-lapse imaging of {DiOC}6-labeled cells shows that the channels undergo changes in morphology and spatial distribution within the interphase nucleus on a timescale of minutes., The presence of a cytoplasmic core and nuclear pore complexes in the channel walls suggests a possible role for these structures in nucleo–cytoplasmic transport. The clear association of a subset of these structures with nucleoli would also be consistent with such a transport role.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex have been classified primarily by their differences in axonal and dendritic branching patterns observed in material impregnated by the Golgi method. Although these morphological differences are widely believed to reflect differences in connectivity, very little is actually known about the patterns of synaptic input to different cell types. We have obtained such information for 32 adjacent neurons in layer {IVab} of cat cortical area 17 by reconstructing them from electron micrographs of 150 serial sections. Synaptic terminals from the lateral geniculate nucleus were labeled in this material by anterograde degeneration and their distribution, as well as that of normal terminals containing flat or round vesicles, was recorded. The neurons were divided into seven classes based on differences in size, shape, dendritic branching pattern and synaptic input. Class I cells were pyramidal with apical and basilar dendrites, dendritic spines, exclusively flat-vesicle terminals on the somas (11/100 micron2), and geniculate terminals  on the basilar dendrites. Class {II} cells were large stellates (20 micron diameter) with dark cytoplasm and numerous flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals on the somas (48/100 micron2). Geniculate terminals contacted the cell bodies and primary, secondary, and tertiary dendrites. The Class {III} cell was stellate with varicose dendrites, a sparse distribution of flat-vesicle terminals (8/100 micron2) on the soma, and both geniculate and round-vesicle terminals on the dendrites. Class {IV} cells had radially elongated somas with sharply tapered apical and basilar dendrites bearing spines. There was a medium distribution of flat-vesicles terminals (17/100 mu2), to the somas while geniculate terminals were restricted to the secondary dendrites. Class V cells were multipolar with flat-vesicle terminals on the somas (11/100 micron2) and a few geniculate terminals on the dendrites. Class {VI} cells were mostly small (as small as 7 micron diameter), with a sparse distribution on the somas of both flat-vesicle terminals (7/100 micron2). Two cells had geniculate terminals on their somas. Class {VII} cells had sharply tapered apical and basilar dendrites, both flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals on the somas (14/100 micron2), and no geniculate input. The results make clear that the neurons in layer {IVab} are quite heterogeneous, not merely in their intrinsic morphology, but also in their patterns of connectivity. The geniculate input is not funneled to a single type of neuron but diverges widely, contacting at least six different cell types, and may form on each a pattern that is characteristic for the type. The reconstruction approach, in providing a detailed identification of the synaptic patterns on substantial numbers of adjacent cells, should make it possible to address directly certain unanswered questions about cortical circuitry...},

Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of {PCs} can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical {PCs}. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of {PCs} in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.},

	abstract = {3D electron microscopy ({EM}) has been successful at mapping invertebrate nervous systems, but the approach has been limited to small chunks of mammalian brains. To scale up to larger volumes, we have built a computational pipeline for processing petascale image datasets acquired by serial section {EM}, a popular form of 3D {EM}. The pipeline employs convolutional nets to compute the nonsmooth transformations required to align images of serial sections containing numerous cracks and folds, detect neuronal boundaries, label voxels as axon, dendrite, soma, and other semantic categories, and detect synapses and assign them to presynaptic and postsynaptic segments. The output of neuronal boundary detection is segmented by mean affinity agglomeration with semantic and size constraints. Pipeline operations are implemented by leveraging distributed and cloud computing. Intermediate results of the pipeline are held in cloud storage, and can be effortlessly viewed as images, which aids debugging. We applied the pipeline to create an automated reconstruction of an {EM} image volume spanning four visual cortical areas of a mouse brain. Code for the pipeline is publicly available, as is the reconstructed volume.},

	abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit extreme diversity in gene expression as well as in morphological and electrophysiological properties1,2. Most existing neural taxonomies are based on either transcriptomic3,4 or morpho-electric5,6 criteria, as it has been technically challenging to study both aspects of neuronal diversity in the same set of cells7. Here we used Patch-seq8 to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell {RNA} sequencing of more than 1,300 neurons in adult mouse primary motor cortex, providing a morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. We found that, although broad families of transcriptomic types (those expressing Vip, Pvalb, Sst and so on) had distinct and essentially non-overlapping morpho-electric phenotypes, individual transcriptomic types within the same family were not well separated in the morpho-electric space. Instead, there was a continuum of variability in morphology and electrophysiology, with neighbouring transcriptomic cell types showing similar morpho-electric features, often without clear boundaries between them. Our results suggest that neuronal types in the neocortex do not always form discrete entities. Instead, neurons form a hierarchy that consists of distinct non-overlapping branches at the level of families, but can form continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within families.},

This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds and well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named {PointNet}, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, {PointNet} is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.},

To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, here we analysed 23,822 cells from two areas at distant poles of the mouse neocortex: the primary visual cortex and the anterior lateral motor cortex. We define 133 transcriptomic cell types by deep, single-cell {RNA} sequencing. Nearly all types of {GABA} (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing neurons are shared across both areas, whereas most types of glutamatergic neurons were found in one of the two areas. By combining single-cell {RNA} sequencing and retrograde labelling, we match transcriptomic types of glutamatergic neurons to their long-range projection specificity. Our study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct areas of the adult mouse cortex.},

Although some new spines have been shown to contain synapses, little is known about the relationship between spine addition and synapse formation, the relative time course of these events, or whether they are coupled to de novo growth of axonal boutons. We imaged dendrites in barrel cortex of adult mice over 1 month, tracking gains and losses of spines. Using serial section electron microscopy, we analyzed the ultrastructure of spines and associated boutons. Spines reconstructed shortly after they appeared often lacked synapses, whereas spines that persisted for 4 d or more always had synapses. New spines had a large surface-to-volume ratio and preferentially contacted boutons with other synapses. In some instances, two new spines contacted the same axon. Our data show that spine growth precedes synapse formation and that new synapses form preferentially onto existing boutons.},

	abstract = {Synaptic activity initiates many adaptive responses in neurons. Here we report a novel form of structural plasticity in dissociated hippocampal cultures and slice preparations. Using a recently developed algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction and quantitative measurements of cell organelles, we found that many nuclei from hippocampal neurons are highly infolded and form unequally sized nuclear compartments. Nuclear infoldings are dynamic structures, which can radically transform the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity. Action potential bursting causing synaptic {NMDA} receptor activation dramatically increases the number of infolded nuclei via a process that requires the {ERK}-{MAP} kinase pathway and new protein synthesis. In contrast, death-signaling pathways triggered by extrasynaptic {NMDA} receptors cause a rapid loss of nuclear infoldings. Compared with near-spherical nuclei, infolded nuclei have a larger surface and increased nuclear pore complex immunoreactivity. Nuclear calcium signals evoked by cytosolic calcium transients are larger in small nuclear compartments than in the large compartments of the same nucleus; moreover, small compartments are more efficient in temporally resolving calcium signals induced by trains of action potentials in the theta frequency range (5 Hz). Synaptic activity-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 was more robust in neurons with infolded nuclei compared with neurons with near-spherical nuclei, suggesting a functional link between nuclear geometry and transcriptional regulation. The translation of synaptic activity-induced signaling events into changes in nuclear geometry facilitates the relay of calcium signals to the nucleus, may lead to the formation of nuclear signaling microdomains, and could enhance signal-regulated transcription.},

Towards this goal, we combined spatially precise optogenetic stimulation with multicellular recording to deeply characterize intralaminar and translaminar monosynaptic connections to supragranular (L2/3) neurons in the mouse visual cortex. The reliability and specificity of multiphoton optogenetic stimulation were measured across multiple Cre lines, and measurements of connectivity were verified by comparison to paired recordings and targeted patching of optically identified presynaptic cells. With a focus on translaminar pathways, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections from genetically defined presynaptic populations were characterized by their relative abundance, spatial profiles, strength, and short-term dynamics. Consistent with the canonical cortical microcircuit, layer 4 excitatory neurons and interneurons within L2/3 represented the most common sources of input to L2/3 pyramidal cells. More surprisingly, we also observed strong excitatory connections from layer 5 intratelencephalic neurons and potent translaminar inhibition from multiple interneuron subclasses. The hybrid approach revealed convergence to and divergence from excitatory and inhibitory neurons within and across cortical layers. Divergent excitatory connections often spanned hundreds of microns of horizontal space. In contrast, divergent inhibitory connections were more frequently measured from postsynaptic targets near each other.},

	abstract = {The pyramidal cells in area 17 of rat visual cortex have been examined by light microscopy using Golgi preparations and semithin plastic sections, and by electron microscopy. Pyramidal cells have cell bodies in layers {II}-{VIa}. The pyramidal cells in the lower portion of layer {II}/{III} are typical examples of this neuronal type in that they have pyramidal-shaped cell bodies, apical dendrites which ascend to layer I, and a skirt of basal dendrites. The pyramidal cells in upper layer {II}/{III} are similar in form but have shorter apical dendrites, while the most superficial pyramidal cells lack apical dendrites and instead have two or more primary dendrites that emanate from the upper surface of their somata. In layer V the pyramidal cells are of two sizes, medium and large, and both have a typical morphology, although the larger neurons have thicker apical dendrites and better-developed axon hillocks than the medium-sized pyramids. The medium-sized pyramidal cells of layer V outnumber the large ones to a ratio of 2.5:1. In layer {IV} a few typical medium-sized pyramidal cells are present, but the majority are small and can be regarded as star pyramids for they have dendrites radiating in all directions. No clearly identified spiny stellate cells have been encountered in layer {IV}. The pyramidal cells of layer {VIa} are also small, and most of them have apical dendrites which only ascend as far as layer {IV}. In addition to these varieties, both inverted and horizontally inclined pyramidal cells have been encountered. In electron micrographs it is apparent that although all of the pyramidal cells have symmetric axosomatic synapses, the frequency with which these synapses occur varies. The cell bodies of the various forms of pyramidal cells do not show a standard cytology. The medium-sized pyramidal cells of layer {II}/{III} usually have rounded nuclei, while the nuclei of the small pyramidal cells of layers {IV} and {VIa} are somewhat more irregular, and the large pyramidal cells of layer V have deeply indented nuclear envelopes. The appearance of the perikaryal cytoplasm also varies. The larger pyramidal cells have numerous mitochondria and well-developed Nissl bodies in their perikaryal cytoplasm, but the smaller cells have much-less-pronounced mitochondria and their rough endoplasmic reticulum is only organized into stacks at the bases of dendrites. Pyramidal cells account for about 87\% of profiles of neuronal cell bodies with nuclei in layer {II}/{III}, 90\% in layer {IV}, 89\% in layer V, and 97\% in layer {VIa}.},

Unlike previously described L5 {CC} and {CS} neurons, this new subtype does not project to striatum [cortico-cortical, non-striatal ({CC}-{NS})] and has distinct morphology, physiology, and visual responses. Monosynaptic rabies tracing reveals that {CC} neurons preferentially receive input from higher visual areas, while {CS} neurons receive more input from structures implicated in top-down modulation of brain states. {CS} neurons are also more direction-selective and prefer faster stimuli than {CC} neurons. These differences suggest distinct roles as specialized output channels, with {CS} neurons integrating information and generating responses more relevant to movement control and {CC} neurons being more important in visual perception.},

Comparison to similar mouse cortex single cell {RNA}-sequencing datasets revealed a surprisingly well-conserved cellular architecture that enables matching of homologous types and predictions of human cell type properties. Despite this general conservation, we also find extensive differences between homologous human and mouse cell types, including dramatic alterations in proportions, laminar distributions, gene expression, and morphology.

	abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex have been classified primarily by their differences in axonal and dendritic branching patterns observed in material impregnated by the Golgi method. Although these morphological differences are widely belieyed to reflect differences in connectivity, very little is actually known about the patterns of synaptic input to different cell types. We have obtained such information for 32 adjacent neurons in layer {IVab} of cat cortical area 17 by reconstructing them from electron micrographs of 150 serial sections. Synaptic terminals from the lateral geniculate nucleus were labeled in this material by anterograde degeneration and their distribution, as well as that of normal terminals containing flat or round vesicles, was recorded. The neurons were divided into seven classes based on differences in size, shape, dendritic branching pattern and synaptic input. Class I cells were pyramidal with apical and basilar dendrites, dendritic spines, exclusively flat-vesicle terminals on the somas (11/100 μm2), and geniculate terminals on the basilar dendrites. Class {II} cells were large stellates (20 μm diameter) with dark cytoplasm and numerous flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals on the somas (48/100 μm2). Geniculate terminals contacted the cell bodies and primary, secondary, and tertiary dendrites. The Class {III} cell was stellate with varicose dendrites, a sparse distribution of flat-vesicle terminals (8/100 μm2) on the soma, and both geniculate and round-vesicle terminals on the dendrites. Class {IV} cells had radially elongated somas with sharply tapered apical and basilar dendrites bearing spines. There was a meduim distribution of flat-vesicles terminals (17/100 μ2), to the somas while geniculate terminals were restricted to the secondary dendrites. Class V cells were multipolar with flat-vesicle terminals on the somas (11/100 μm2) and a few geniculate terminals on the dendrites. Class {VI} cells were mostly small (as small as 7 μm diameter), with a sparse distribution on the somas of both flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals (7/100 μm2). Two cells had geniculate terminals on their somas. Class {VII} cells had sharply tapered apical and basilar dendrites, both flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals on the somas (14/100 μm2), and no geniculate input. The results make clear that the neurons in layer {IVab} are quite heterogeneous, not merely in their intrinsic morphology, but also in their patterns of connectivity. The geniculate input is not funneled to a single type of neuron but diverges widely, contacting at least six different cell types, and may form on each a pattern that is characteristic for the type. The reconstruction approach, in providing a detailed identification of the synaptic patterns on substantial numbers of adjacent cells, should make it possible to address directly certain unanswered questions about cortical circuitry. It should be possible to determine, for example, whether the synaptic patterns described here are constant enough to allow identification of the same cell class in different animals as is the case for neurons of invertebrates. It might also be possible to determine for specific cell classes how the synaptic patterns change during development and under unusual rearing conditions.},

	abstract = {A prolonged developmental timeline for {GABA} (γ-aminobutyric acid)-expressing inhibitory neurons ({GABAergic} interneurons) is an amplified trait in larger, gyrencephalic animals. In several species, the generation, migration, and maturation of interneurons take place over several months, in some cases persisting after birth. The late integration of {GABAergic} interneurons occurs in a region-specific pattern, especially during the early postnatal period. These changes can contribute to the formation of functional connectivity and plasticity, especially in the cortical regions responsible for higher cognitive tasks. In this review, we discuss {GABAergic} interneuron development in the late gestational and postnatal forebrain. We propose the protracted development of interneurons at each stage (neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and network integration), as a mechanism for increased complexity and cognitive flexibility in larger, gyrencephalic brains. This developmental feature of interneurons also provides an avenue for environmental influences to shape neural circuit formation.},

	abstract = {Parvalbumin ({PV})-producing fast-spiking neurons are well known to generate gamma oscillation by mutual chemical and electrical connections in the neocortex. Although it was clearly demonstrated that {PV} neurons form a dense gap junction network with each other not only at the proximal sites but also at the distal dendrites, comprehensive quantitative data on the chemical connections are still lacking. To elucidate the connectivity, we investigated inhibitory inputs to {PV} neurons in the somatosensory cortex, using the transgenic mice in which the dendrites and cell bodies of {PV} neurons were clearly visualized. We first examined {GABAergic} inputs to {PV} neurons by labeling postsynaptic and presynaptic sites with the immunoreactivities for gephyrin and vesicular {GABA} transporter. The density of {GABAergic} inputs was highest on the cell bodies, and almost linearly decreased to the distal dendrites. We then investigated inhibitory inputs from three distinct subgroups of {GABAergic} interneurons by visualizing the axon terminals immunopositive for {PV}, somatostatin ({SOM}), or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ({VIP}). {PV} and {SOM} inputs were frequently located on the dendrites with the ratio of 2.5:1, but much less on the cell bodies. By contrast, {VIP} inputs clearly preferred the cell bodies to the dendrites. Consequently, the dendritic and somatic compartments of {PV} neurons received ∼60 and 62\% of inhibitory inputs from {PV} and {VIP} neurons, respectively. This compartmental organization of inhibitory inputs suggests that {PV} neurons, together with gap junctions, constitute mutual connections at the dendrites, and that their activities are negatively controlled by the somatic inputs of {VIP} neurons.},

	abstract = {Cortical inhibitory interneurons have a wide range of important functions, including balancing network excitation, enhancing spike-time precision of principal neurons, and synchronizing neural activity within and across brain regions. All these functions critically depend on the integration of synaptic inputs in their dendrites. But the sparse number of inhibitory cells, their small caliber dendrites, and the problem of cell-type identification, have prevented fast progress in analyzing their dendritic properties. Despite these challenges, recent advancements in electrophysiological, optical and molecular tools have opened the door for studying synaptic integration and dendritic computations in molecularly defined inhibitory interneurons. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biophysical properties of inhibitory neuron dendrites differ substantially from those of pyramidal neurons. In addition to the supralinear dendritic integration commonly observed in pyramidal neurons, interneuron dendrites can also integrate synaptic inputs in a linear or sublinear fashion. In this comprehensive review, we compare the dendritic biophysical properties of the three major classes of cortical inhibitory neurons and discuss how these cell type-specific properties may support their functions in the cortex.},

	abstract = {Dendritic spines are the nearly ubiquitous site of excitatory synaptic input onto neurons and as such are critically positioned to influence diverse aspects of neuronal signalling. Decades of theoretical studies have proposed that spines may function as highly effective and modifiable chemical and electrical compartments that regulate synaptic efficacy, integration and plasticity. Experimental studies have confirmed activity-dependent structural dynamics and biochemical compartmentalization by spines. However, there is a longstanding debate over the influence of spines on the electrical aspects of synaptic transmission and dendritic operation. Here we measure the amplitude ratio of spine head to parent dendrite voltage across a range of dendritic compartments and calculate the associated spine neck resistance (R(neck)) for spines at apical trunk dendrites in rat hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons. We find that R(neck) is large enough ({\textasciitilde}500 {MΩ}) to amplify substantially the spine head depolarization associated with a unitary synaptic input by {\textasciitilde}1.5- to {\textasciitilde}45-fold, depending on parent dendritic impedance. A morphologically realistic compartmental model capable of reproducing the observed spatial profile of the amplitude ratio indicates that spines provide a consistently high-impedance input structure throughout the dendritic arborization. Finally, we demonstrate that the amplification produced by spines encourages electrical interaction among coactive inputs through an R(neck)-dependent increase in spine head voltage-gated conductance activation. We conclude that the electrical properties of spines promote nonlinear dendritic processing and associated forms of plasticity and storage, thus fundamentally enhancing the computational capabilities of neurons.},

	abstract = {Dendritic spines are small protrusions from the dendrite membrane, where contact with neighboring axons is formed in order to receive synaptic input. Changes in size, shape, and density of synaptic spines are associated with learning and memory, and observed after drug abuse in a variety of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Due to the preeminent importance of synaptic spines, there have been major efforts into developing techniques that enable visualization and analysis of dendritic spines in cultured neurons, in fixed slices and in intact brain tissue. The classification of synaptic spines into predefined morphological groups is a standard approach in neuroscience research, where spines are divided into fixed categories such as thin, mushroom, and stubby subclasses. This study examines accumulated evidence that supports the existence of dendritic spine shapes as a continuum rather than separated classes. Using new approaches and software tools we reflect on complex dendritic spine shapes, positing that understanding of their highly dynamic nature is required to perform analysis of their morphology. The study discusses and compares recently developed algorithms that rely on clusterization rather than classification, therefore enabling new levels of spine shape analysis. We reason that improved methods of analysis may help to investigate a link between dendritic spine shape and its function, facilitating future studies of learning and memory as well as studies of brain disorders.},

The resulting terminology might provide a stepping stone towards a future classification of these complex and heterogeneous cells.

	abstract = {The morphology and distribution of cells which do not conform to the conventional pyramidal pattern have been investigated in rapid Golgi, Golgi-Kopsch and Golgi-Cox preparations from cortical areas 3, 1 and 2 of juvenile and mature squirrel monkeys. The material has been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by means of a computer program which permits cells to be rotated so as to display their three-dimensional architecture. Nine non-pyramidal types are identified of which one is a rare giant cell and another, forming a major proportion of the cells in layer {VI}, is considered to be a modified form of pyramidal cell. Of the other seven types, two have horizontally distributed axons, one essentially confined to layer {II}, the other sending long (up to 1 mm) branches anter-posteriorly through all layers. Two types have vertical axons. One, corresponding to the "double bouquet dendritique" cell of Cajal, is mainly situated in layer {II} or the upper part of layer {III} and has a cluster of large axon branches which descend to layers {IV} and V and which enclose and terminate on the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The other type is the only non-pyramidal cell which has a relatively high concentration of dendritic spines in the adult animal. Its soma lies in layer {IV} and it has several strongly recurrent, thick axonal branches ascending to layer {II}, also enclosing the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The dendritic field is not truly stellate but is drawn out into a pronounced ascending tuft which ascends into layer {IIIb}. The cell thus resembles a "star-pyramid" of Lorente de Nó. Nevertheless such cells have many features, notably the distribution of their axons and the distribution of dendritic spines which are identical to those of the well-known "spiny stellate" cell of the visual cortex. Conversely the same features both in these cells and in the spiny stellate cells of the visual cortex (which were also eamined) differ markedly from those of small pyramidal cells with somata of similar dimensions. The three remaining non-pyramida cell types have locally ramifying axons which appear to terminate predominantly on pyramidal cells. In one, the axon forms smoothly curving arcades in layer {III}, in another it is intensely tangled in layer {IV} and in the third it is bush-like in layers {II}-{IV}. continued.},

	abstract = {We have studied the neuronal circuitry and structure-function relationships of single neurones in the striate visual cortex of the cat using a combination of electrophysiological and anatomical techniques. Glass micropipettes filled with horseradish peroxidase were used to record extracellularly from single neurones. After studying the receptive field properties, the afferent inputs of the neurones were studied by determining their latency of response to electrical stimulation at different positions along the optic pathway. Some cells were thus classified as receiving a mono- or polysynaptic input from afferents of the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.), via X- or Y-like retinal ganglion cells. Two striking correlations were found between dendritic morphology and receptive field type. All spiny stellate cells, and all star pyramidal cells in layer 4A, had receptive fields with spatially separate on and off subfields (S-type receptive fields). All the identified afferent input to these, the major cell types in layer 4, was monosynaptic from X- or Y-like afferents. Neurones receiving monosynaptic X- or Y-like input were not strictly segregated in layer 4 and the lower portion of layer 3. Nevertheless the X- and Y-like l.g.n. fibres did not converge on any of the single neurones so far studied. Monosynaptic input from the l.g.n. afferents was not restricted to cells lying within layers 4 and 6, the main termination zones of the l.g.n. afferents, but was also received by cells lying in layers 3 and 5. The projection pattern of cells receiving monosynaptic input differed widely, depending on the laminar location of the cell soma. This suggests the presence of a number of divergent paths within the striate cortex. Cells receiving indirect input from the l.g.n. afferents were located mainly within layers 2, 3 and 5. Most pyramidal cells in layer 3 had axons projecting out of the striate cortex, while many axons of the layer 5 pyramids did not. The layer 5 cells showed the most morphological variation of any layer, were the most difficult to activate by electrical stimulation, and contained some cells which responded with the longest latencies of any cells in the striate cortex. This suggests that they were several synapses distant from the l.g.n. input. The majority of cells in layers 2, 3, 4 and 6 had the same basic S-type receptive field structure. Only layer 5 contained a majority of cells with spatially overlapping on and off subfields (C- and B-type receptive fields).({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings followed by histochemical staining and single-cell {RT}-{PCR} were obtained from 180 Martinotti interneurones located in layers {II} to {VI} of the somatosensory cortex of Wistar rats (P13-P16) in order to examine their anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular properties. Martinotti cells ({MCs}) mostly displayed ovoid-shaped somata, bitufted dendritic morphologies, and axons with characteristic spiny boutons projecting to layer I and spreading horizontally across neighbouring columns more than 1 mm. Electron microscopic examination of {MC} boutons revealed that all synapses were symmetrical and most synapses (71\%) were formed onto dendritic shafts. {MCs} were found to contact tuft, apical and basal dendrites in multiple neocortical layers: layer {II}/{III} {MCs} targeted mostly layer I and to a lesser degree layer {II}/{III}; layer {IV} {MCs} targeted mostly layer {IV} and to a lesser degree layer I; layer V and {VI} {MCs} targeted mostly layer {IV} and layer I and to a lesser degree the layer in which their somata was located. {MCs} typically displayed spike train accommodation (90\%; n = 127) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections, but some displayed non-accommodating (8\%) and a few displayed irregular spiking responses (2\%). Some accommodating and irregular spiking {MCs} also responded initially with bursts (17\%). Accommodating responses were found in all layers, non-accommodating mostly in upper layers and bursting mostly in layer V. Single-cell multiplex {RT}-{PCR} performed on 63 {MCs} located throughout layers {II}-{VI}, revealed that all {MCs} were somatostatin ({SOM}) positive, and negative for parvalbumin ({PV}) as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide ({VIP}). Calbindin ({CB}), calretinin ({CR}), neuropeptide Y ({NPY}) and cholecystokinin ({CCK}) were co- expressed with {SOM} in some {MCs}. Some layer-specific trends seem to exist. Finally, 24 accommodating {MCs} were examined for the expression of 26 ion channel genes. The ion channels with the highest expression in these {MCs} were (from highest to lowest); Cabeta1, Kv3.3, {HCN}4, Cabeta4, Kv3.2, Kv3.1, Kv2.1, {HCN}3, Caalpha1G, Kv3.4, Kv4.2, Kv1.1 and {HCN}2. In summary, this study provides the first detailed analysis of the anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells located in different neocortical layers. It is proposed that {MCs} are crucial interneurones for feedback inhibition in and between neocortical layers and columns.},

	abstract = {Synaptic activity initiates many adaptive responses in neurons. Here we report a novel form of structural plasticity in dissociated hippocampal cultures and slice preparations. Using a recently developed algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction and quantitative measurements of cell organelles, we found that many nuclei from hippocampal neurons are highly infolded and form unequally sized nuclear compartments. Nuclear infoldings are dynamic structures, which can radically transform the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity. Action potential bursting causing synaptic {NMDA} receptor activation dramatically increases the number of infolded nuclei via a process that requires the {ERK}-{MAP} kinase pathway and new protein synthesis. In contrast, death-signaling pathways triggered by extrasynaptic {NMDA} receptors cause a rapid loss of nuclear infoldings. Compared with near-spherical nuclei, infolded nuclei have a larger surface and increased nuclear pore complex immunoreactivity. Nuclear calcium signals evoked by cytosolic calcium transients are larger in small nuclear compartments than in the large compartments of the same nucleus; moreover, small compartments are more efficient in temporally resolving calcium signals induced by trains of action potentials in the theta frequency range (5 Hz). Synaptic activity-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 was more robust in neurons with infolded nuclei compared with neurons with near-spherical nuclei, suggesting a functional link between nuclear geometry and transcriptional regulation. The translation of synaptic activity-induced signaling events into changes in nuclear geometry facilitates the relay of calcium signals to the nucleus, may lead to the formation of nuclear signaling microdomains, and could enhance signal-regulated transcription.},

To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, here we analysed 23,822 cells from two areas at distant poles of the mouse neocortex: the primary visual cortex and the anterior lateral motor cortex. We define 133 transcriptomic cell types by deep, single-cell {RNA} sequencing. Nearly all types of {GABA} (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing neurons are shared across both areas, whereas most types of glutamatergic neurons were found in one of the two areas. By combining single-cell {RNA} sequencing and retrograde labelling, we match transcriptomic types of glutamatergic neurons to their long-range projection specificity. Our study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct areas of the adult mouse cortex.},

Our network, named {PointNet}, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, {PointNet} is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.},

Most existing neural taxonomies are based on either transcriptomic3,4 or morpho-electric5,6 criteria, as it has been technically challenging to study both aspects of neuronal diversity in the same set of cells7. Here we used Patch-seq8 to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell {RNA} sequencing of more than 1,300 neurons in adult mouse primary motor cortex, providing a morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. We found that, although broad families of transcriptomic types (those expressing Vip, Pvalb, Sst and so on) had distinct and essentially non-overlapping morpho-electric phenotypes, individual transcriptomic types within the same family were not well separated in the morpho-electric space. Instead, there was a continuum of variability in morphology and electrophysiology, with neighbouring transcriptomic cell types showing similar morpho-electric features, often without clear boundaries between them. Our results suggest that neuronal types in the neocortex do not always form discrete entities. Instead, neurons form a hierarchy that consists of distinct non-overlapping branches at the level of families, but can form continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within families.},

To scale up to larger volumes, we have built a computational pipeline for processing petascale image datasets acquired by serial section {EM}, a popular form of 3D {EM}. The pipeline employs convolutional nets to compute the nonsmooth transformations required to align images of serial sections containing numerous cracks and folds, detect neuronal boundaries, label voxels as axon, dendrite, soma, and other semantic categories, and detect synapses and assign them to presynaptic and postsynaptic segments. The output of neuronal boundary detection is segmented by mean affinity agglomeration with semantic and size constraints. Pipeline operations are implemented by leveraging distributed and cloud computing. Intermediate results of the pipeline are held in cloud storage, and can be effortlessly viewed as images, which aids debugging. We applied the pipeline to create an automated reconstruction of an {EM} image volume spanning four visual cortical areas of a mouse brain. Code for the pipeline is publicly available, as is the reconstructed volume.},

Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of {PCs} can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical {PCs}. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of {PCs} in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have opened up new possibilities to investigate chromosomal and nuclear 3D organization on the nanoscale. We here discuss their potential for elucidating topographical details of the nuclear lamina. Single molecule localization microscopy ({SMLM}) in combination with immunostainings of lamina proteins readily reveals tube-like invaginations with a diameter of 100–500 nm. Although these invaginations have been established as a frequent and general feature of interphase nuclei across different cell types, their formation mechanism and function have remained largely elusive. We critically review the current state of research, propose possible connections to lamina associated domains ({LADs}), and revisit the discussion about the potential role of these invaginations for accelerating {mRNA} nuclear export. Illustrative studies using 3D super-resolution imaging are shown and will be instrumental to decipher the physiological role of these nanoscale invaginations.},

	abstract = {The nuclear envelope consists of a doublemembraned extension of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In this report we describe long, dynamic tubular channels, derived from the nuclear envelope, that extend deep into the nucleoplasm. These channels show cell-type specific morphologies ranging from single short stubs to multiple, complex, branched structures. Some channels transect the nucleus entirely, opening at two separate points on the nuclear surface, while others terminate at or close to nucleoli. These channels are distinct from other topological features of the nuclear envelope, such as lobes or folds., The channel wall consists of two membranes continuous with the nuclear envelope, studded with features indistinguishable from nuclear pore complexes, and decorated on the nucleoplasmic surface with lamins. The enclosed core is continuous with the cytoplasm, and the lumenal space between the membranes contains soluble {ER}-resident proteins (protein disulphide isomerase and glucose-6-phosphatase)., Nuclear channels are also found in live cells labeled with the lipophilic dye {DiOC}6. Time-lapse imaging of {DiOC}6-labeled cells shows that the channels undergo changes in morphology and spatial distribution within the interphase nucleus on a timescale of minutes., The presence of a cytoplasmic core and nuclear pore complexes in the channel walls suggests a possible role for these structures in nucleo–cytoplasmic transport. The clear association of a subset of these structures with nucleoli would also be consistent with such a transport role.},

To better constrain the deﬁnition of neuronal cell types, we characterized the transcriptomes and intrinsic physiological properties of over 4,200 mouse visual cortical {GABAergic} interneurons and reconstructed the local morphologies of 517 of those neurons. We ﬁnd that most transcriptomic types (t-types) occupy speciﬁc laminar positions within visual cortex, and, for most types, the cells mapping to a t-type exhibit consistent electrophysiological and morphological properties. These properties display both discrete and continuous variation among t-types. Through multimodal integrated analysis, we deﬁne 28 met-types that have congruent morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties and robust mutual predictability. We identify layer-speciﬁc axon innervation pattern as a deﬁning feature distinguishing different met-types. These met-types represent a uniﬁed deﬁnition of cortical {GABAergic} interneuron types, providing a systematic framework to capture existing knowledge and bridge future analyses across different modalities.},

	abstract = {Alteration of the nuclear Ca2+ transient is an early event in cardiac remodeling. Regulation of the nuclear Ca2+ transient is partly independent of the cytosolic Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes. One nuclear membrane protein, emerin, is encoded by {EMD}, and an {EMD} mutation causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ({EDMD}). It remains unclear whether emerin is involved in nuclear Ca2+ homeostasis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of emerin in rat cardiomyocytes by means of hypertrophic stimuli and in {EDMD} induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cell-derived cardiomyocytes in terms of nuclear structure and the Ca2+ transient. The cardiac hypertrophic stimuli increased the nuclear area, decreased nuclear invagination, and increased the half-decay time of the nuclear Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes. Emd knockdown cardiomyocytes showed similar properties after hypertrophic stimuli. The {EDMD}-{iPS} cell-derived cardiomyocytes showed increased nuclear area, decreased nuclear invagination, and increased half-decay time of the nuclear Ca2+ transient. An autopsied heart from a patient with {EDMD} also showed increased nuclear area and decreased nuclear invagination. These data suggest that Emerin plays a crucial role in nuclear structure and in the nuclear Ca2+ transient. Thus, emerin and the nuclear Ca2+ transient are possible therapeutic targets in heart failure and {EDMD}.},

	abstract = {We acquired a rapidly preserved human surgical sample from the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. We stained a 1 mm3 volume with heavy metals, embedded it in resin, cut more than 5000 slices at ∼30 nm and imaged these sections using a high-speed multibeam scanning electron microscope. We used computational methods to render the three-dimensional structure containing 57,216 cells, hundreds of millions of neurites and 133.7 million synaptic connections. The 1.4 petabyte electron microscopy volume, the segmented cells, cell parts, blood vessels, myelin, inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and 104 manually proofread cells are available to peruse online. Many interesting and unusual features were evident in this dataset. Glia outnumbered neurons 2:1 and oligodendrocytes were the most common cell type in the volume. Excitatory spiny neurons comprised 69\% of the neuronal population, and excitatory synapses also were in the majority (76\%). The synaptic drive onto spiny neurons was biased more strongly toward excitation (70\%) than was the case for inhibitory interneurons (48\%). Despite incompleteness of the automated segmentation caused by split and merge errors, we could automatically generate (and then validate) connections between most of the excitatory and inhibitory neuron types both within and between layers. In studying these neurons we found that deep layer excitatory cell types can be classified into new subsets, based on structural and connectivity differences, and that chandelier interneurons not only innervate excitatory neuron initial segments as previously described, but also each other’s initial segments. Furthermore, among the thousands of weak connections established on each neuron, there exist rarer highly powerful axonal inputs that establish multi-synaptic contacts (up to ∼20 synapses) with target neurons. Our analysis indicates that these strong inputs are specific, and allow small numbers of axons to have an outsized role in the activity of some of their postsynaptic partners.},

	abstract = {The neocortex contains diverse populations of excitatory neurons segregated by layer and further definable by their specific cortical and subcortical projection targets. The current study describes a systematic approach to identify molecular correlates of specific projection neuron classes in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1), using a combination of in situ hybridization ({ISH}) data mining, marker gene colocalization, and combined retrograde labeling with {ISH} for layer-specific marker genes. First, we identified a large set of genes with specificity for each cortical layer, and that display heterogeneous patterns within those layers. Using these genes as markers, we find extensive evidence for the covariation of gene expression and projection target specificity in layer 2/3, 5, and 6, with individual genes labeling neurons projecting to specific subsets of target structures. The combination of gene expression and target specificity imply a great diversity of projection neuron classes that is similar to or greater than that of {GABAergic} interneurons. The covariance of these 2 phenotypic modalities suggests that these classes are both discrete and genetically specified.},

	abstract = {Alteration of the nuclear Ca2+ transient is an early event in cardiac remodeling. Regulation of the nuclear Ca2+ transient is partly independent of the cytosolic Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes. One nuclear membrane protein, emerin, is encoded by {EMD}, and an {EMD} mutation causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ({EDMD}). It remains unclear whether emerin is involved in nuclear Ca2+ homeostasis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of emerin in rat cardiomyocytes by means of hypertrophic stimuli and in {EDMD} induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cell-derived cardiomyocytes in terms of nuclear structure and the Ca2+ transient. The cardiac hypertrophic stimuli increased the nuclear area, decreased nuclear invagination, and increased the half-decay time of the nuclear Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes. Emd knockdown cardiomyocytes showed similar properties after hypertrophic stimuli. The {EDMD}-{iPS} cell-derived cardiomyocytes showed increased nuclear area, decreased nuclear invagination, and increased half-decay time of the nuclear Ca2+ transient. An autopsied heart from a patient with {EDMD} also showed increased nuclear area and decreased nuclear invagination. These data suggest that Emerin plays a crucial role in nuclear structure and in the nuclear Ca2+ transient. Thus, emerin and the nuclear Ca2+ transient are possible therapeutic targets in heart failure and {EDMD}.},

The relative number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs across individual dendrites and neurons are the hardware of local dendritic and cellular computations. In this chapter, we discuss the structural and functional observations that have guided the understanding of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization across the neuronal arbor, the subcellular targeting properties of different neuronal subtypes, and the effects of synaptic placement on local integration within dendritic segments. We focus primarily on the adult mammalian cortex and hippocampus, where excitatory and inhibitory cell types, their connectivity, and its functional implications have been best characterized.},

However, in practice, anatomical connectivity and physiology have been studied mostly separately. Following in the footsteps of previous studies that have combined physiology and anatomy in the same tissue, here we present a unique functional connectomics dataset that contains calcium imaging of an estimated 75,000 neurons from primary visual cortex ({VISp}) and three higher visual areas ({VISrl}, {VISal} and {VISlm}), that were recorded while a mouse viewed natural movies and parametric stimuli. The functional data were co-registered with electron microscopy ({EM}) data of the same volume which were automatically segmented, reconstructing more than 200,000 cells (neuronal and non-neuronal) and 524 million synapses. Subsequent proofreading of some neurons in this volume yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections. The largest proofread excitatory axon reached a length of 19 mm and formed 1893 synapses, while the largest inhibitory axon formed 10081 synapses. Here we release this dataset as an open access resource to the scientific community including a set of analysis tools that allows easy data access, both programmatically and through a web user interface.},

We ﬁnd that most transcriptomic types (t-types) occupy speciﬁc laminar positions within visual cortex, and, for most types, the cells mapping to a t-type exhibit consistent electrophysiological and morphological properties. These properties display both discrete and continuous variation among t-types. Through multimodal integrated analysis, we deﬁne 28 met-types that have congruent morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties and robust mutual predictability. We identify layer-speciﬁc axon innervation pattern as a deﬁning feature distinguishing different met-types.

	abstract = {The nuclear envelope consists of a doublemembraned extension of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In this report we describe long, dynamic tubular channels, derived from the nuclear envelope, that extend deep into the nucleoplasm. These channels show cell-type specific morphologies ranging from single short stubs to multiple, complex, branched structures. Some channels transect the nucleus entirely, opening at two separate points on the nuclear surface, while others terminate at or close to nucleoli. These channels are distinct from other topological features of the nuclear envelope, such as lobes or folds., The channel wall consists of two membranes continuous with the nuclear envelope, studded with features indistinguishable from nuclear pore complexes, and decorated on the nucleoplasmic surface with lamins. The enclosed core is continuous with the cytoplasm, and the lumenal space between the membranes contains soluble {ER}-resident proteins (protein disulphide isomerase and glucose-6-phosphatase)., Nuclear channels are also found in live cells labeled with the lipophilic dye {DiOC}6. Time-lapse imaging of {DiOC}6-labeled cells shows that the channels undergo changes in morphology and spatial distribution within the interphase nucleus on a timescale of minutes., The presence of a cytoplasmic core and nuclear pore complexes in the channel walls suggests a possible role for these structures in nucleo–cytoplasmic transport. The clear association of a subset of these structures with nucleoli would also be consistent with such a transport role.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex have been classified primarily by their differences in axonal and dendritic branching patterns observed in material impregnated by the Golgi method. Although these morphological differences are widely believed to reflect differences in connectivity, very little is actually known about the patterns of synaptic input to different cell types. We have obtained such information for 32 adjacent neurons in layer {IVab} of cat cortical area 17 by reconstructing them from electron micrographs of 150 serial sections. Synaptic terminals from the lateral geniculate nucleus were labeled in this material by anterograde degeneration and their distribution, as well as that of normal terminals containing flat or round vesicles, was recorded. The neurons were divided into seven classes based on differences in size, shape, dendritic branching pattern and synaptic input. Class I cells were pyramidal with apical and basilar dendrites, dendritic spines, exclusively flat-vesicle terminals on the somas (11/100 micron2), and geniculate terminals on the basilar dendrites. Class {II} cells were large stellates (20 micron diameter) with dark cytoplasm and numerous flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals on the somas (48/100 micron2). Geniculate terminals contacted the cell bodies and primary, secondary, and tertiary dendrites. The Class {III} cell was stellate with varicose dendrites, a sparse distribution of flat-vesicle terminals (8/100 micron2) on the soma, and both geniculate and round-vesicle terminals on the dendrites. Class {IV} cells had radially elongated somas with sharply tapered apical and basilar dendrites bearing spines. There was a medium distribution of flat-vesicles terminals (17/100 mu2), to the somas while geniculate terminals were restricted to the secondary dendrites. Class V cells were multipolar with flat-vesicle terminals on the somas (11/100 micron2) and a few geniculate terminals on the dendrites. Class {VI} cells were mostly small (as small as 7 micron diameter), with a sparse distribution on the somas of both flat-vesicle terminals (7/100 micron2). Two cells had geniculate terminals on their somas. Class {VII} cells had sharply tapered apical and basilar dendrites, both flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals on the somas (14/100 micron2), and no geniculate input. The results make clear that the neurons in layer {IVab} are quite heterogeneous, not merely in their intrinsic morphology, but also in their patterns of connectivity. The geniculate input is not funneled to a single type of neuron but diverges widely, contacting at least six different cell types, and may form on each a pattern that is characteristic for the type. The reconstruction approach, in providing a detailed identification of the synaptic patterns on substantial numbers of adjacent cells, should make it possible to address directly certain unanswered questions about cortical circuitry...},

We critically review the current state of research, propose possible connections to lamina associated domains ({LADs}), and revisit the discussion about the potential role of these invaginations for accelerating {mRNA} nuclear export.

We here discuss their potential for elucidating topographical details of the nuclear lamina. Single molecule localization microscopy ({SMLM}) in combination with immunostainings of lamina proteins readily reveals tube-like invaginations with a diameter of 100–500 nm. Although these invaginations have been established as a frequent and general feature of interphase nuclei across different cell types, their formation mechanism and function have remained largely elusive. We critically review the current state of research, propose possible connections to lamina associated domains ({LADs}), and revisit the discussion about the potential role of these invaginations for accelerating {mRNA} nuclear export. Illustrative studies using 3D super-resolution imaging are shown and will be instrumental to decipher the physiological role of these nanoscale invaginations.},

Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of {PCs} can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical {PCs}. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of {PCs} in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.},

	abstract = {3D electron microscopy ({EM}) has been successful at mapping invertebrate nervous systems, but the approach has been limited to small chunks of mammalian brains. To scale up to larger volumes, we have built a computational pipeline for processing petascale image datasets acquired by serial section {EM}, a popular form of 3D {EM}. The pipeline employs convolutional nets to compute the nonsmooth transformations required to align images of serial sections containing numerous cracks and folds, detect neuronal boundaries, label voxels as axon, dendrite, soma, and other semantic categories, and detect synapses and assign them to presynaptic and postsynaptic segments. The output of neuronal boundary detection is segmented by mean affinity agglomeration with semantic and size constraints. Pipeline operations are implemented by leveraging distributed and cloud computing. Intermediate results of the pipeline are held in cloud storage, and can be effortlessly viewed as images, which aids debugging. We applied the pipeline to create an automated reconstruction of an {EM} image volume spanning four visual cortical areas of a mouse brain. Code for the pipeline is publicly available, as is the reconstructed volume.},

Most existing neural taxonomies are based on either transcriptomic3,4 or morpho-electric5,6 criteria, as it has been technically challenging to study both aspects of neuronal diversity in the same set of cells7. Here we used Patch-seq8 to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell {RNA} sequencing of more than 1,300 neurons in adult mouse primary motor cortex, providing a morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. We found that, although broad families of transcriptomic types (those expressing Vip, Pvalb, Sst and so on) had distinct and essentially non-overlapping morpho-electric phenotypes, individual transcriptomic types within the same family were not well separated in the morpho-electric space. Instead, there was a continuum of variability in morphology and electrophysiology, with neighbouring transcriptomic cell types showing similar morpho-electric features, often without clear boundaries between them. Our results suggest that neuronal types in the neocortex do not always form discrete entities. Instead, neurons form a hierarchy that consists of distinct non-overlapping branches at the level of families, but can form continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within families.},

Our network, named {PointNet}, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, {PointNet} is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.},

Nearly all types of {GABA} (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing neurons are shared across both areas, whereas most types of glutamatergic neurons were found in one of the two areas.

Using serial section electron microscopy, we analyzed the ultrastructure of spines and associated boutons. Spines reconstructed shortly after they appeared often lacked synapses, whereas spines that persisted for 4 d or more always had synapses. New spines had a large surface-to-volume ratio and preferentially contacted boutons with other synapses. In some instances, two new spines contacted the same axon.

	abstract = {Synaptic activity initiates many adaptive responses in neurons. Here we report a novel form of structural plasticity in dissociated hippocampal cultures and slice preparations. Using a recently developed algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction and quantitative measurements of cell organelles, we found that many nuclei from hippocampal neurons are highly infolded and form unequally sized nuclear compartments. Nuclear infoldings are dynamic structures, which can radically transform the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity. Action potential bursting causing synaptic {NMDA} receptor activation dramatically increases the number of infolded nuclei via a process that requires the {ERK}-{MAP} kinase pathway and new protein synthesis. In contrast, death-signaling pathways triggered by extrasynaptic {NMDA} receptors cause a rapid loss of nuclear infoldings. Compared with near-spherical nuclei, infolded nuclei have a larger surface and increased nuclear pore complex immunoreactivity. Nuclear calcium signals evoked by cytosolic calcium transients are larger in small nuclear compartments than in the large compartments of the same nucleus; moreover, small compartments are more efficient in temporally resolving calcium signals induced by trains of action potentials in the theta frequency range (5 Hz). Synaptic activity-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 was more robust in neurons with infolded nuclei compared with neurons with near-spherical nuclei, suggesting a functional link between nuclear geometry and transcriptional regulation. The translation of synaptic activity-induced signaling events into changes in nuclear geometry facilitates the relay of calcium signals to the nucleus, may lead to the formation of nuclear signaling microdomains, and could enhance signal-regulated transcription.},

The reliability and specificity of multiphoton optogenetic stimulation were measured across multiple Cre lines, and measurements of connectivity were verified by comparison to paired recordings and targeted patching of optically identified presynaptic cells. With a focus on translaminar pathways, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections from genetically defined presynaptic populations were characterized by their relative abundance, spatial profiles, strength, and short-term dynamics. Consistent with the canonical cortical microcircuit, layer 4 excitatory neurons and interneurons within L2/3 represented the most common sources of input to L2/3 pyramidal cells. More surprisingly, we also observed strong excitatory connections from layer 5 intratelencephalic neurons and potent translaminar inhibition from multiple interneuron subclasses. The hybrid approach revealed convergence to and divergence from excitatory and inhibitory neurons within and across cortical layers. Divergent excitatory connections often spanned hundreds of microns of horizontal space. In contrast, divergent inhibitory connections were more frequently measured from postsynaptic targets near each other.},

Pyramidal cells have cell bodies in layers {II}-{VIa}. The pyramidal cells in the lower portion of layer {II}/{III} are typical examples of this neuronal type in that they have pyramidal-shaped cell bodies, apical dendrites which ascend to layer I, and a skirt of basal dendrites. The pyramidal cells in upper layer {II}/{III} are similar in form but have shorter apical dendrites, while the most superficial pyramidal cells lack apical dendrites and instead have two or more primary dendrites that emanate from the upper surface of their somata. In layer V the pyramidal cells are of two sizes, medium and large, and both have a typical morphology, although the larger neurons have thicker apical dendrites and better-developed axon hillocks than the medium-sized pyramids. The medium-sized pyramidal cells of layer V outnumber the large ones to a ratio of 2.5:1. In layer {IV} a few typical medium-sized pyramidal cells are present, but the majority are small and can be regarded as star pyramids for they have dendrites radiating in all directions. No clearly identified spiny stellate cells have been encountered in layer {IV}. The pyramidal cells of layer {VIa} are also small, and most of them have apical dendrites which only ascend as far as layer {IV}. In addition to these varieties, both inverted and horizontally inclined pyramidal cells have been encountered. In electron micrographs it is apparent that although all of the pyramidal cells have symmetric axosomatic synapses, the frequency with which these synapses occur varies. The cell bodies of the various forms of pyramidal cells do not show a standard cytology. The medium-sized pyramidal cells of layer {II}/{III} usually have rounded nuclei, while the nuclei of the small pyramidal cells of layers {IV} and {VIa} are somewhat more irregular, and the large pyramidal cells of layer V have deeply indented nuclear envelopes. The appearance of the perikaryal cytoplasm also varies. The larger pyramidal cells have numerous mitochondria and well-developed Nissl bodies in their perikaryal cytoplasm, but the smaller cells have much-less-pronounced mitochondria and their rough endoplasmic reticulum is only organized into stacks at the bases of dendrites. Pyramidal cells account for about 87\% of profiles of neuronal cell bodies with nuclei in layer {II}/{III}, 90\% in layer {IV}, 89\% in layer V, and 97\% in layer {VIa}.},

Previous studies demonstrate two L5 pyramid types: cortico-cortical ({CC}) and cortico-subcortical ({CS}). We characterize connectivity and function of these cell types in mouse primary visual cortex and reveal a new subtype. Unlike previously described L5 {CC} and {CS} neurons, this new subtype does not project to striatum [cortico-cortical, non-striatal ({CC}-{NS})] and has distinct morphology, physiology, and visual responses. Monosynaptic rabies tracing reveals that {CC} neurons preferentially receive input from higher visual areas, while {CS} neurons receive more input from structures implicated in top-down modulation of brain states. {CS} neurons are also more direction-selective and prefer faster stimuli than {CC} neurons. These differences suggest distinct roles as specialized output channels, with {CS} neurons integrating information and generating responses more relevant to movement control and {CC} neurons being more important in visual perception.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex have been classified primarily by their differences in axonal and dendritic branching patterns observed in material impregnated by the Golgi method. Although these morphological differences are widely belieyed to reflect differences in connectivity, very little is actually known about the patterns of synaptic input to different cell types. We have obtained such information for 32 adjacent neurons in layer {IVab} of cat cortical area 17 by reconstructing them from electron micrographs of 150 serial sections. Synaptic terminals from the lateral geniculate nucleus were labeled in this material by anterograde degeneration and their distribution, as well as that of normal terminals containing flat or round vesicles, was recorded. The neurons were divided into seven classes based on differences in size, shape, dendritic branching pattern and synaptic input. Class I cells were pyramidal with apical and basilar dendrites, dendritic spines, exclusively flat-vesicle terminals on the somas (11/100 μm2), and geniculate terminals on the basilar dendrites. Class {II} cells were large stellates (20 μm diameter) with dark cytoplasm and numerous flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals on the somas (48/100 μm2). Geniculate terminals contacted the cell bodies and primary, secondary, and tertiary dendrites. The Class {III} cell was stellate with varicose dendrites, a sparse distribution of flat-vesicle terminals (8/100 μm2) on the soma, and both geniculate and round-vesicle terminals on the dendrites. Class {IV} cells had radially elongated somas with sharply tapered apical and basilar dendrites bearing spines. There was a meduim distribution of flat-vesicles terminals (17/100 μ2), to the somas while geniculate terminals were restricted to the secondary dendrites. Class V cells were multipolar with flat-vesicle terminals on the somas (11/100 μm2) and a few geniculate terminals on the dendrites. Class {VI} cells were mostly small (as small as 7 μm diameter), with a sparse distribution on the somas of both flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals (7/100 μm2). Two cells had geniculate terminals on their somas. Class {VII} cells had sharply tapered apical and basilar dendrites, both flat-vesicle and round-vesicle terminals on the somas (14/100 μm2), and no geniculate input. The results make clear that the neurons in layer {IVab} are quite heterogeneous, not merely in their intrinsic morphology, but also in their patterns of connectivity. The geniculate input is not funneled to a single type of neuron but diverges widely, contacting at least six different cell types, and may form on each a pattern that is characteristic for the type. The reconstruction approach, in providing a detailed identification of the synaptic patterns on substantial numbers of adjacent cells, should make it possible to address directly certain unanswered questions about cortical circuitry. It should be possible to determine, for example, whether the synaptic patterns described here are constant enough to allow identification of the same cell class in different animals as is the case for neurons of invertebrates. It might also be possible to determine for specific cell classes how the synaptic patterns change during development and under unusual rearing conditions.},

In several species, the generation, migration, and maturation of interneurons take place over several months, in some cases persisting after birth. The late integration of {GABAergic} interneurons occurs in a region-specific pattern, especially during the early postnatal period. These changes can contribute to the formation of functional connectivity and plasticity, especially in the cortical regions responsible for higher cognitive tasks. In this review, we discuss {GABAergic} interneuron development in the late gestational and postnatal forebrain. We propose the protracted development of interneurons at each stage (neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and network integration), as a mechanism for increased complexity and cognitive flexibility in larger, gyrencephalic brains. This developmental feature of interneurons also provides an avenue for environmental influences to shape neural circuit formation.},

	abstract = {Cortical inhibitory interneurons have a wide range of important functions, including balancing network excitation, enhancing spike-time precision of principal neurons, and synchronizing neural activity within and across brain regions. All these functions critically depend on the integration of synaptic inputs in their dendrites. But the sparse number of inhibitory cells, their small caliber dendrites, and the problem of cell-type identification, have prevented fast progress in analyzing their dendritic properties. Despite these challenges, recent advancements in electrophysiological, optical and molecular tools have opened the door for studying synaptic integration and dendritic computations in molecularly defined inhibitory interneurons. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biophysical properties of inhibitory neuron dendrites differ substantially from those of pyramidal neurons. In addition to the supralinear dendritic integration commonly observed in pyramidal neurons, interneuron dendrites can also integrate synaptic inputs in a linear or sublinear fashion. In this comprehensive review, we compare the dendritic biophysical properties of the three major classes of cortical inhibitory neurons and discuss how these cell type-specific properties may support their functions in the cortex.},

	abstract = {Dendritic spines are the nearly ubiquitous site of excitatory synaptic input onto neurons and as such are critically positioned to influence diverse aspects of neuronal signalling. Decades of theoretical studies have proposed that spines may function as highly effective and modifiable chemical and electrical compartments that regulate synaptic efficacy, integration and plasticity. Experimental studies have confirmed activity-dependent structural dynamics and biochemical compartmentalization by spines. However, there is a longstanding debate over the influence of spines on the electrical aspects of synaptic transmission and dendritic operation. Here we measure the amplitude ratio of spine head to parent dendrite voltage across a range of dendritic compartments and calculate the associated spine neck resistance (R(neck)) for spines at apical trunk dendrites in rat hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons. We find that R(neck) is large enough ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde500 {MΩ}) to amplify substantially the spine head depolarization associated with a unitary synaptic input by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.5- to {\textbackslash}textasciitilde45-fold, depending on parent dendritic impedance. A morphologically realistic compartmental model capable of reproducing the observed spatial profile of the amplitude ratio indicates that spines provide a consistently high-impedance input structure throughout the dendritic arborization. Finally, we demonstrate that the amplification produced by spines encourages electrical interaction among coactive inputs through an R(neck)-dependent increase in spine head voltage-gated conductance activation. We conclude that the electrical properties of spines promote nonlinear dendritic processing and associated forms of plasticity and storage, thus fundamentally enhancing the computational capabilities of neurons.},

Changes in size, shape, and density of synaptic spines are associated with learning and memory, and observed after drug abuse in a variety of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Due to the preeminent importance of synaptic spines, there have been major efforts into developing techniques that enable visualization and analysis of dendritic spines in cultured neurons, in fixed slices and in intact brain tissue. The classification of synaptic spines into predefined morphological groups is a standard approach in neuroscience research, where spines are divided into fixed categories such as thin, mushroom, and stubby subclasses. This study examines accumulated evidence that supports the existence of dendritic spine shapes as a continuum rather than separated classes. Using new approaches and software tools we reflect on complex dendritic spine shapes, positing that understanding of their highly dynamic nature is required to perform analysis of their morphology. The study discusses and compares recently developed algorithms that rely on clusterization rather than classification, therefore enabling new levels of spine shape analysis. We reason that improved methods of analysis may help to investigate a link between dendritic spine shape and its function, facilitating future studies of learning and memory as well as studies of brain disorders.},

	abstract = {The morphology and distribution of cells which do not conform to the conventional pyramidal pattern have been investigated in rapid Golgi, Golgi-Kopsch and Golgi-Cox preparations from cortical areas 3, 1 and 2 of juvenile and mature squirrel monkeys. The material has been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by means of a computer program which permits cells to be rotated so as to display their three-dimensional architecture. Nine non-pyramidal types are identified of which one is a rare giant cell and another, forming a major proportion of the cells in layer {VI}, is considered to be a modified form of pyramidal cell. Of the other seven types, two have horizontally distributed axons, one essentially confined to layer {II}, the other sending long (up to 1 mm) branches anter-posteriorly through all layers. Two types have vertical axons. One, corresponding to the "double bouquet dendritique" cell of Cajal, is mainly situated in layer {II} or the upper part of layer {III} and has a cluster of large axon branches which descend to layers {IV} and V and which enclose and terminate on the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The other type is the only non-pyramidal cell which has a relatively high concentration of dendritic spines in the adult animal. Its soma lies in layer {IV} and it has several strongly recurrent, thick axonal branches ascending to layer {II}, also enclosing the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The dendritic field is not truly stellate but is drawn out into a pronounced ascending tuft which ascends into layer {IIIb}. The cell thus resembles a "star-pyramid" of Lorente de Nó. Nevertheless such cells have many features, notably the distribution of their axons and the distribution of dendritic spines which are identical to those of the well-known "spiny stellate" cell of the visual cortex. Conversely the same features both in these cells and in the spiny stellate cells of the visual cortex (which were also eamined) differ markedly from those of small pyramidal cells with somata of similar dimensions. The three remaining non-pyramida cell types have locally ramifying axons which appear to terminate predominantly on pyramidal cells. In one, the axon forms smoothly curving arcades in layer {III}, in another it is intensely tangled in layer {IV} and in the third it is bush-like in layers {II}-{IV}. continued.},

	abstract = {We have studied the neuronal circuitry and structure-function relationships of single neurones in the striate visual cortex of the cat using a combination of electrophysiological and anatomical techniques. Glass micropipettes filled with horseradish peroxidase were used to record extracellularly from single neurones. After studying the receptive field properties, the afferent inputs of the neurones were studied by determining their latency of response to electrical stimulation at different positions along the optic pathway. Some cells were thus classified as receiving a mono- or polysynaptic input from afferents of the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.), via X- or Y-like retinal ganglion cells. Two striking correlations were found between dendritic morphology and receptive field type. All spiny stellate cells, and all star pyramidal cells in layer 4A, had receptive fields with spatially separate on and off subfields (S-type receptive fields). All the identified afferent input to these, the major cell types in layer 4, was monosynaptic from X- or Y-like afferents. Neurones receiving monosynaptic X- or Y-like input were not strictly segregated in layer 4 and the lower portion of layer 3. Nevertheless the X- and Y-like l.g.n. fibres did not converge on any of the single neurones so far studied. Monosynaptic input from the l.g.n. afferents was not restricted to cells lying within layers 4 and 6, the main termination zones of the l.g.n. afferents, but was also received by cells lying in layers 3 and 5. The projection pattern of cells receiving monosynaptic input differed widely, depending on the laminar location of the cell soma. This suggests the presence of a number of divergent paths within the striate cortex. Cells receiving indirect input from the l.g.n. afferents were located mainly within layers 2, 3 and 5. Most pyramidal cells in layer 3 had axons projecting out of the striate cortex, while many axons of the layer 5 pyramids did not. The layer 5 cells showed the most morphological variation of any layer, were the most difficult to activate by electrical stimulation, and contained some cells which responded with the longest latencies of any cells in the striate cortex. This suggests that they were several synapses distant from the l.g.n. input. The majority of cells in layers 2, 3, 4 and 6 had the same basic S-type receptive field structure. Only layer 5 contained a majority of cells with spatially overlapping on and off subfields (C- and B-type receptive fields).({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},
